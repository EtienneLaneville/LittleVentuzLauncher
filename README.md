# Little Ventuz Launcher

This application takes a list of Ventuz VPRs and will launch them continously, one after the other, in hopes of getting the elusive "Ventuz is already running" error:

## Usage
1. Enter a list of VPR paths and the target Ventuz verison to launch in the **VPRs** textbox. Each line should contain the full VPR path and the major Ventuz version to use, separated by a comma.
2. Click the **Start Launching** button
